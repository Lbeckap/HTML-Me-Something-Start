         <h2>Why I want to go.</h2>
         <p>My dad was in the Air Force and would always tell stories about where he was stationed. His favorite place
            to talk about was Japan, and of course, it quickly became my dream destination. The history and culture are
            so interesting that I've even started learning the language. „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØüëã Learning about Japan from a distance is
            great, but experiencing everything firsthand would be an entirely different level of amazing.</p>

         <h2>Where I would visit.</h2>
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">...if I had to list my top 5 destinations.</p>

         <h3>1. Himeji Castle</h3>
         <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/himejiCastle.jpg" alt="Himeji Castle">
         </div>
         <p>As you continue reading, you'll notice a clear theme: I love nature! üçÉüåª Although not a garden, river, or
            mountain, this castle is too beautiful to miss. I first saw Himeji Castle while watching NHK, and ever
            since, it has been the number one place I would like to visit.</p>

         <h3>2. Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</h3>

         <h3>3. Mt. Fuji</h3>
         <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/mtFuji.jpg" alt="Mt. Fuji">
         </div>
         <p>Fuji-san! üóª You can't go to Japan and not see one of the most iconic mountains in the world. Unfortunately,
            I'm not much of a climber. However, that's not going to stop me from getting as close as possible and
            checking out the best spots for viewing.</p>

         <h3>4. Takachiho Gorge</h3>
         <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/takachihoGorge.webp" alt="Takachiho Gorge">
         </div>
         <p>It's estimated that this was formed over 100,000 years ago. Such a spectacular sight! You can also rent a
            small boat and paddle down the river. The view from the walking path looks amazing too. I would love to pack
            a lunch and spend the day here.</p>

         <h3>5. Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
         <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/bambooGrove.webp" alt="Arashiyama Bamboo Grove">
         </div>
         <p>I've read that the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove can get pretty busy with a lot of foot traffic, and that the best
            time to visit is early in the morning. The good news is that it is open 24 hours a day! I think it could be
            pretty cool to visit at night too. ü§î</p>

         <h2>Realistically...</h2>
         <p>These five attractions are really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to everything I would like to
            see and experience on my trip. üöÖ Also, geographically, they are quite spread out. This could make planning
            a route a bit challenging. üöû So hopefully, with time, patience, and careful planning, in the near future,
            I'll be able to visit all of these places and more.</p>

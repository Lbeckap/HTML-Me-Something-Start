        <h2>Why I want to go.</h2>
        <p>
          My dad would talk about places where he was stationed in the past. One
          of his favorite places to talk about was Japan, and of course, it
          quickly became my dream destination. The history and culture are so
          interesting that I've even started learning the language. „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØüëã
          Learning about Japan from a distance is great, but experiencing
          everything firsthand would be an entirely different level of amazing.

        <h2>Where I would visit.</h2>
        <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
          ...if I had to list my top 5 destinations.
        </p>
        <h3>1. Himeji Castle</h3>
        <div class="inline">
          <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/himejiCastle.jpg" alt="Himeji Castle" />
          </div>
          <p>
            As you continue reading, you'll notice a clear theme: I love nature!
            üçÉüåª Although not a garden, river, or mountain, this castle is too
            beautiful to miss. I first saw Himeji Castle while watching NHK, and
            ever since, it has been the number one place I would like to visit.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>2. Kyoto Gyoen National Garden</h3>
        <div class="inline">
          <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img
              src="./images/nationalGarden.jpg"
              alt="Kyoto Gyoen National Garden"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The size of this "garden" is no joke. It's about 1,300 meters by 700
            meters. I believe I would have to visit multiple days to be able to
            really experience all it has to offer. It also used to be home to
            the Imperial family. üéé It appears to be open 24/7, admission is
            free, and... it has tennis courts. Too good to be true. I wonder if
            it is possible to live nearby.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>3. Mt. Fuji</h3>
        <div class="inline">
          <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/mtFuji.jpg" alt="Mt. Fuji" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Fuji-san! üóª You can't go to Japan and not see one of the most
            iconic mountains in the world. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a
            climber. However, that's not going to stop me from getting as close
            as possible and checking out the best spots for viewing.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>4. Takachiho Gorge</h3>
        <div class="inline">
          <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img src="./images/takachihoGorge.webp" alt="Takachiho Gorge" />
          </div>
          <p>
            It's estimated that this was formed over 100,000 years ago. Such a
            spectacular sight! You can also rent a small boat and paddle down
            the river. The view from the walking path looks amazing too. I would
            love to pack a lunch and spend the day here.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3>5. Arashiyama Bamboo Grove</h3>
        <div class="inline">
          <div class="imgPolaroid">
            <img
              src="./images/bambooGrove.webp"
              alt="Arashiyama Bamboo Grove"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            I've read that the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove can get pretty busy with
            a lot of foot traffic, and that the best time to visit is early in
            the morning. The good news is that it is open 24 hours a day! I
            think it could be pretty cool to visit at night too. ü§î

        <h2>Realistically...</h2>
        <p>
          These five attractions are really only the tip of the iceberg when it
          comes to everything I would like to see and experience on my trip. üöÖ
          Also, geographically, they are quite spread out. This could make
          planning a route a bit challenging. üöû So hopefully, with time,
          patience, and careful planning, in the near future, I'll be able to
          visit all of these places and more.

          Japan has a small island where rabbits rule. üêá Okunoshima was
          infamous for its role in chemical warfare during World War II and is
          now a popular tourist attraction thanks to its bunny population.
